Hello everyone, 
My name is Ricardo. I have a dabbled in learning programing a bit. The language I am trying to focus on at the moment is python. If someone asks me why python, well, I would not really have a clue. Just thought it would be a good place to start is all. Anyway, I am transitioning from being a writer, and I am still trying to figure out what to do with my life.
